List of future enhancements/fixes:

-Rename files including & in their name.
-Deal with bad files gracefully.
-Database cleanup, remove data relating to removed files.
-Seek further on blank/solid/stationary frames.  Should also remove these sections from trace.  Perhaps part of the border detection.
