List of future enhancements/fixes:

-Seek further on blank/solid/stationary frames.  Should also remove these sections from trace.  Perhaps part of the border detection.  Some intros have animation, so perhaps it would be better to just set a later start time for traces.
-Save/restore previous sort options/directories
-Implement search/sort system
-Improve preview feature with controls/dynamic window size.  Perhaps no decoration.
